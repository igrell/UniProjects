# UniProjects

This is the portfolio of some projects I've written across the years as part of courses of Bachelor's degree in Computer Mathematics and Master's degree in Computer Science, comprising courses such as "Programming", "Methods of Programming", "Algorithms and Data Structures" and "Numerical Methods". Projects have been categorized according to the programming language in which they were written. Below a short overview according to the course.

## Programming
### `dynamic_memory`
An exercise in dynamic memory allocation using the standard syntax of C.

### `structs`
An exercise exploring the basics of OOP.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
### `fft_polynomials`
An implementation of polynomial arithmetic and evaluation, including efficient polynomial multiplication using Fast Fourier Transform. 

### `triangles`
An implementation of a simple algorithm for counting all possible triangles that can be constructed from a set of points.

### `backpacking_problem`
A solution to the classic backpacking problem.

### `inf_onp`
A parser from the RPN to the INF arithmetic notation and vice-versa, implemented using a stack.

### `max_subarrays`
An implementation of the Kadane algorithm for two-dimensional arrays.

### `metadata_sort`
An exercise in efficient data structure sorting.

### `sequence_merging`
An exercise in efficient sequence merging using a heap.

### `song_selection`
An implementation of the median of medians algorithm.

### `song_shuffling`
A modified version of the iterative quicksort algorithm.

### `trains`
An efficient implementation of various list data structures. 

## Numerical Methods
### `geometric_sequences`
A program finding a geometric sequence of three numbers from their sum and product.

### `fad`
An exercise in Forward Automatic Differentation of second degree for multivariable functions.

### `root_finder`
A combination of the bisection and secant root finding methods for efficient root finding in single-variable functions.

### `newton_method`
An implementation of root finding in multivariable functions using Newton method.

### `scaled_gauss`
An implementation of the optimized version of Gauss method for solving systems of linear equations.  

### `sor`
An implementation of the SOR method for solving systems of linear equations.

### `interpolation`
A program calculating the Hermite interpolating polynomial for a given set of points.
